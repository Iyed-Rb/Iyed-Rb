# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Iyed Rabia Cherif

## About Me
I'm a computer science student currently finishing my first year. I'm passionate about programming and algorithms, and I'm exploring different areas of software development. I enjoy solving problems and want to keep expanding my knowledge in this field through practice, real-world projects, and continuous learning.

## Skills

**Programming Languages**  
- C++: Used for small console applications and algorithm practice  
- C#: Used for building desktop apps with Windows Forms  

**Databases**  
- Basic knowledge of SQL (designing simple databases, writing basic queries)

## Projects
I regularly update my GitHub with projects I complete as part of my learning journey. Most of them are built in C++ or C#, focusing on logic, structure, and good code practices.

## Goals
- Expand my programming knowledge by building full projects  
- Learn how to use databases effectively in real applications  
- Improve my software development skills and collaborate more  
- Continue learning new technologies step by step

## Notes
I'm currently working on improving my GitHub profile and organizing my work. I'm always open to learning, sharing, and building together.
